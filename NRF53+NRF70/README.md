# Cardspansion-NRF
The third MCU to be added to the Cardspansion series, it features the Minewsemi ME16WS03. It is a Wi-Fi 6 + BLE combo module, which contains both an NRF5340 and NRF7002. The module contains two U.FL connectors, and there is a keepout zone to avoid external noise from reaching the components. There are no need for external crystals, as they are already included inside the module. Compared to the previous Cardspansion modules however, this module is larger in size, so the text has to be relocated to the side of the card.
## Features
- I2C
- UART
- SPI
- RTC support
- SWDIO
- I2S (Input and Output)
