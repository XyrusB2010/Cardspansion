# Cardspansion-U5
The first MCU of the series, the Cardspansion-U5 features a STM32U575CITX. It is best suited for low power applications which may still require lots of processing performance. This card features also features two crystal oscillators (ASE 8MHz and ASEK 32.768KHz) to drive the STM32U5's low power and RTC clock.
